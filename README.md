# BMad Method V1

The original version was a simple tech demo of showing how different custom agile personas could be used to build out the artifacts to have AI Agents plan and execute on building complex applications from scratch, with an emphasis on planning enough for an MVP to while filling in enough details to keep developer agents on the rails.

Its simplicity was amazing, but it did not include a lot of customization - and using this in the web was more of an after thought that came later with V2. It was possible but complicated and not clearly communicated with V1.

This initial version also had each custom mode prompt hard coded to the template that would all be part of the agent custom mode. This would not have worked well with many IDEs, and was very rigid in scope and purpose.
