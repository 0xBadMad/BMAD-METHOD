# Prompt to Generate the Granular Stories

Review ./.ai-pm/stories.md and without changing ANY content, generate all of the
individual story files to add to ./ai-pm/1-ToDo/. Each story in the file has a title, which will drive the file name. And each story has a separator between each story block. The content for each story block will be the only contents within each file you will create.

Each story block starts with **Story ID:** `<Story_ID>`, the file you will create for that block will be `<Story_ID>`.md.
